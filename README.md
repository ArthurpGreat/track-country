This contains code for a web application that allows users to track and add visited countries. The application uses JavaScript, Express, and PostgreSQL to create a server and interact with a database. Users can input a country name, which is then used to retrieve the corresponding country code from the database. The country code is then added to the "visited_countries" table in the database. The homepage of the application displays a map with highlighted countries that have been visited.
